/**
 * <p>Removes the connection between the webhook that was created by CodePipeline and the

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CodePipelineClient, DeregisterWebhookWithThirdPartyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-codepipeline"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CodePipelineClient, DeregisterWebhookWithThirdPartyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-codepipeline"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CodePipelineClient(config);
 * const command = new DeregisterWebhookWithThirdPartyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeregisterWebhookWithThirdPartyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeregisterWebhookWithThirdPartyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CodePipelineClientResolvedConfig | config} for CodePipelineClient's `config` shape.
