/**
 * <p>Sets the retention of the specified log group. A retention policy allows you to
 *       configure the number of days for which to retain log events in the specified log
 *       group.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>CloudWatch Logs doesn’t immediately delete log events when they reach their retention setting.
 *       It typically takes up to 72 hours after that before log events are deleted, but in rare situations might take longer.</p>
 *             <p>This means that if you change a log group to have a longer retention setting when it contains log events
 *         that are past the expiration date, but haven’t been actually deleted, those log events will take
 *         up to 72 hours to be deleted after the new retention date is reached. To make sure
 *         that log data is deleted permanently, keep a log group at its lower retention setting until 72 hours has passed
 *         after the end of the previous
 *         retention period, or you have confirmed that the older log events are deleted.
 *       </p>
 *          </note>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.

 * import { CloudWatchLogsClient, PutRetentionPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudWatchLogsClient, PutRetentionPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudWatchLogsClient(config);
 * const command = new PutRetentionPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link PutRetentionPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutRetentionPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudWatchLogsClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudWatchLogsClient's `config` shape.
