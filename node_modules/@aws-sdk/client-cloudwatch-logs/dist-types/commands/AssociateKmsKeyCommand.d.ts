/**
 * <p>Associates the specified Key Management Service customer master key (CMK) with the specified log group.</p>
 *          <p>Associating an KMS CMK with a log group overrides any existing associations between the log group and a CMK.
 *       After a CMK is associated with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the CMK.
 *       This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the CMK is still within CloudWatch Logs.
 *       This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric CMKs. Do not use an associate an asymmetric CMK
 *         with your log group. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using Symmetric and Asymmetric
 *           Keys</a>.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect.</p>
 *          <p>If you attempt to associate a CMK with a log group but the CMK does not exist or the
 *       CMK is disabled, you receive an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudWatchLogsClient, AssociateKmsKeyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudWatchLogsClient, AssociateKmsKeyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch-logs"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudWatchLogsClient(config);
 * const command = new AssociateKmsKeyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link AssociateKmsKeyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link AssociateKmsKeyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudWatchLogsClientResolvedConfig | config} for CloudWatchLogsClient's `config` shape.
